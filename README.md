# Welcome to my project!

*for now, this is more of a V1.*

This was an exercise in my algorithmic ability, less so as a foray into good UI.

The premise of this app is that you put in different errands you need to run, e.g. 

* Running to the grocery store
* Getting your dry cleaning
* Going to the mall

Where each errand has an associated location. This app will find the shortest pathway between these stops to maximize your efficiency.

  **For those who know it, this is the Traveling Salesman Problem.**

  ## How it works

  I compared a CoreML approach vs reinforcement learning and found that reinforcement learning provided a good answer.
  If you're curious, the code that calculates it is stored in `TravelingSalesman.swift`

  # Future

  I plan on adding additional features at some point

  * Better UI in accordance with Apple Design guidelines
  * Prioritization of Stops
  * Time limit
